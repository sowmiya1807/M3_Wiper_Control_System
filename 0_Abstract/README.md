 # ABSTRACT
   Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be
handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driverâ€™s concentration during the
driving. Thus, this system is proposed to solve all these problems.In this project, there were two innovations reviewed as the literature review. The two were designed with different
concept and operating mechanism however with same objective of working principle of the car wiper. The rain sensor
was a highly versatile device for automatic wiping of vehicle windscreen when it is wet due to moisture, raindrops or
even mud
